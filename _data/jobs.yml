- title: UCSD Research Experience for High Schoolers
  description: The Research Experience for High School Students program, a part of the San Diego Supercomputer Center’s (SDSC) student outreach program, has been developed to help increase awareness of computational science and related fields of research to students in the San Diego region. Students gain exposure to career options, hands-on computational experience, work readiness skills and mentoring by computational research scientists. Through the eight-week volunteer program, students are involved with an established research project. Students learn how to formulate and test hypotheses, conduct computational experiments, and draw conclusions from those experiments. They also learn to take part in regular lab meetings and participate in group discussions. At the end of the program, students will develop scientific posters, reflecting on their summer experience and highlighting their research and future career goals. Posters will be displayed during a celebratory event in mid-August.
